To install Virtual Box guest additions run the following as root:

KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/<latest version>.fc20.x86_64
export KERN_DIR
cd /run/media/jlund3/VBOXADDITIONS_<version>/
./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
reboot

Note that all those commands need to be run in the same session, so use su to
become root rather than use sudo to gain root privileges.
