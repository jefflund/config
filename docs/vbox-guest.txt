Make sure that kernel-devel is installed. Also ensure that you've recently run
a yum update so that the installed kernel source matches the kernel you are
actually using.

To install Virtual Box guest additions start by mounting the guest additions CD.
Then run the following as root:

KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/<latest version>.fc20.x86_64
export KERN_DIR
cd /run/media/jlund3/VBOXADDITIONS_<version>/
./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
reboot

Note that all those commands need to be run in the same session, so use su to
become root rather than use sudo to gain root privileges.
