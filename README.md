config
======

A bunch of personal config files and scripts,
including all of my dotfiles for vim, lxde, tmux, and bash,
and installation scripts for Fedora.

To run the full setup, run ```sudo ./bin/systemize```. This
will setup the home directory, install many packages, and
link the dotfiles. To simply relink the dotfiles, run the
command ```./bin/dotfiles```. Note that once this has been
run, future dotfile syncs can be done by simply running
the command ```dotfiles```.
